90,WarrenBuffettsBuffet,"By Senad Karaahmetovic:

Toni Sacconaghi, a Senior Analyst at Bernstein covering U.S. IT Hardware, has discussed implications for Tesla (TSLA) shares amid an ongoing saga concerning CEO Elon Musk and his deal to acquire Twitter (TWTR) for $44 billion.

Musk may “ultimately elect or be forced to purchase Twitter going forward,” Sacconaghi told clients in a note today. The analyst took note of Musk’s deal to acquire Twitter which should be completed via debt, equity, and a margin loan.

Sacconaghi pays special attention to $12.5 billion that will come from a margin loan facility tied to Tesla stock.

“Following the recent drop in TSLA's stock price, Musk appears to have just enough value in his unencumbered Tesla shares to fund the margin loan portion of his proposed Twitter financing. That said, at a TSLA share price of $621 or less, Musk would technically not be able to borrow the full $12.5B against his shares - in fact, if TSLA's stock price were to drop to $500/share, he would be ~$2.5B short. If the agreed upon deal price for Twitter is ultimately haircut by 10%, Musk could still borrow enough, even if Telsa shares dropped to ~$400,” the analyst wrote.

However, the bigger - but also less probable - financial risk for Elon Musk is there is a deeper pullback in Tesla shares, in combination with him completing the deal.

“If the TWTR deal were to close today and subsequently TSLA's stock price dropped to $350-400, Musk could be forced to sell ~13M Tesla shares.”

In other words, Elon Musk would get a margin call.

Sacconaghi rates Tesla with an Underperform rating and a $450.00 per share price target as he struggles to justify TSLA's valuation, “which appears to imply huge volume AND industry leading profitability going forward, which is historically unprecedented.”

Tesla stock price is indicated to open 2.5% lower today, or at $657.90.

92,Colemuel55,"You are retarded if you believe that… if you have so much money in the market that liquidating that position would have a substantial negative impact on that asset, they would not margin call because they would lose money. You are also acting like the guy who has 4x the net worth of his Twitter offer doesn’t have other assets to pull from. He has financing secured to take Tesla private where he has full control of the direction of the company. This does not mean he is the sole funder. This also does not mean he is even majority share holder. What it does mean, is that in the time period after the deal, he will have full decision making power within Twitter, if it even goes through. And right now it looks like Twitter is going to get hammered by the sec for filing false or unverifiable statements that have significant impact on the value of the company. The CEO even admitted they cannot prove the 5% number they submitted and they cannot allow a third party to verify it. Twitters current business model relies on real traffic to generate advertising value. Bot traffic is not buying products. Twitter cannot force someone to buy a company based on SEC filings.

Yes, pretty much. Elon woke up and decided that while selling off a large chunk of Tesla before a large crash is a good idea, sinking all that money into a struggling company like Twitter isn't the best idea.

Musk's father is estranged from the rest of the family. His father has absolutely nothing to do with Musk. And a wealthy South African from the 70s is about as wealthy as any normal middle class person in a non-crappy country. By your logic, most every single person in WSB should be as wealthy as Musk. Turns out everybody in WSB is wealthy if you simply have them move to a country where 90% of the population lives in squalid poverty!
