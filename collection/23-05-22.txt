30,Telinger,"Let me take a crack at this, let's start with the basics

The overnight lending market is all about the banks moving money around to ensure they have adequate supply but not too much supply.

Banks lend to each other in the open market. The fed tries to manipulate this rate. They announce the Target federal funds rate and then move the interbank rate into that range by dumping or vacuuming up, T-bills, T-bonds, MBS and other such things.

The effort required by the Fed to keep this interbank rate within the target range will show up in the repo market. So what you're seeing in the graph is a massive drive by the fed to keep this rate within the target federal funds rate.

What does all this mean?

Basically, the banks are freaking out a bit. On the one side, they have loan applications drying up (so they have excess cash) and on the other side, they have more people withdrawing money from their savings (reducing excess cash). This is creating massive volatility in the system and it's why you're seeing this huge spike in the Repo Market.",6,{'target'}

32,ShankThatSnitch,"The Fed borrows cash reserve from banks, and pays them a small amount interest. This is being done because the Treasury is not issuing enough T Bills(short term treasuries)for banks to buy. The banks are not allowed to hold too much cash cause of regulations from the great financial crisis. Usually they buy T Bills, but since there is a shortage, the Fed is allowing the extra reverse repo to ease pressure on the banks.

If they didn't do this, the banks would forced to buy longer duration treasuries, which would fuck with the yield curve, and could potentially cause Market panic.",11,{'t'}
33,MoonTanned8,"Repos originally started as a way for banks to lend their securities/loans for cash on an overnight basis to ensure they met liquidity requirements. Prior to the GFC, they borrowed excess reserves from another bank.

During the GFC, it became difficult to determine the liquidity/solvency of financial firms on a day-to-day basis so the liquidity in the repo market dried up. This put otherwise solvent firms at risk of becoming illiquid.

In steps the Fed with a simple solution. They will be your overnight borrower or lender, assuming you collateralize quality securities (not unique/random portfolios of loans). It became difficult for individual banks to compete with the Fed since they essentially would need to have enough liquidity that they would be willing to accept rates below the Fed to offload the excess overnight. That is generally uncommon so more and more liquidity flowed into the Fed each day at 1:30pm instead of being traded amongst banks each day.

That's it. It's not a sign of stress or anything ominous. It's simply the result of the Fed inserting itself as a pseudo-clearinghouse for overnight borrowing/lending.

Tl;Dr: GFC was in part caused by uncertain liquidity availability. Fed knows this is an easily solvable problem so they guarantee the liquidity each day.",5,{'met'}

38,Affectionate-Law1680,"TLDR: that reverse repo rate moves with the target fed funds rate.  The fed hiked 75bps so far this year, the rrp rate went up 75bps

The reverse repo rate is just the floor rate in the fed funds corridor.  The fed instituted it following the gfc bc there was too much money in the system and they were afraid when they raised rates the fed funds rate would not go up (and this would fall outside their target band). It‚Äôs gone from 5bps to 80bps because the fed has hiked rates 75bps.

The reverse repo rate is thus the floor for the rate in the fed funds corridor and the ioer rate is the ceiling (interest on excess reserves). Fed effective rates can trade out of this range, there is a credit component.

Fwiw, that 2 trln won‚Äôt be around much longer. The fed is actively unwinding their balance sheet and draining reserves. As they drain reserves repo rates will move above the reverse repo rate, and no one will have an incentive to park cash at the reverse repo facility.

So rrp usage is going to 0 but it‚Äôs because the the fed is unloading their balance sheet (reducing the amount of reserves and money supply in the system)",20,{'target'}
39,ScipioAtTheGate,"Except that holding funds in the FED eliminates all risk of loss by the bank keeping the fund there, so taking the rate to 0 would still give the banks an incentive to keep the funds there to eliminate risk of loss.

There is so much demand for them right now, it would be 2 trillion of money shifting from the reverse repo to T Bills before the demand starts to have a huge effect on the rate.

Xi wants to level them up. Which would be fine, except their stock market was the second worst performing in the world last year (just ahead of Pakistan, in 59th place).

Namely corruption, expropriation and epic governmental overreach. 

Speaking of, their tech index plunged 61% from its peak last year. Meanwhile, their ten biggest tech firms have lost a combined $1.7trillion in their collective market value. A lot of that's attributed to governmental overreach. 

They also spent a metric fuckton on real estate. About 15% directly, or 25% if you count upstream and downstream sectors.
